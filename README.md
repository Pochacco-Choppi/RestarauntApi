# Running with Docker Compose

If you have Docker Compose installed, you can run RestarauntAPI using the provided `docker-compose.yml` file. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the RestarauntAPI repository from GitHub.
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose if you haven't already.
3. Build Docker Compose containers using `docker-compose build`
4. Start the RestarauntAPI service using Docker Compose: `docker-compose up -d`
5. Access RestarauntAPI in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

To stop RestarauntAPI, run `docker-compose down`. This will stop and remove the containers created by Docker Compose.
